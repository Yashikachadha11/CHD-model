# CHD-model
Coronary Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression and confusion matrix.
This project intends to pinpoint the most relevant factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression. 
The dataset is taken from Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The main goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset includes over 4,000 records and 14 attributes. There are demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.
